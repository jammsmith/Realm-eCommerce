      Doves & Dandy's Westernwear privacy policy is very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will never send you e-mails and/or mailings other than in connection with your
      order, unless you have requested otherwise. When you order from us, all of your information
      is kept strictly confidential and is shared with no one. We will never sell your name or mailing address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our customers are very important to us and we treat them as we expect to be treated by others.
      We will sometimes call you with a question on your order, if you do not want to be contacted
      by this method, please let us know. However, we would like to emphasize that it is the easiest
      way for us to confirm a question on your custom order so there is no delay in its construction or
      delivery. Many of our items are truly unique to the customer so to talk to you personally can
      make sure that everything is correctly measured.
    </p>
