        As our leather and clothing products are made specifically to fit you, we ask
        that you take accurate measurements.  If when you have placed an order and discover
        you have made a mistake, please contact us immediately. Assuming we have not started
        your order, this will allow us to make any corrections necessary. Any corrective work may
        be charged. All of our custom and bespoke items are made to order and not before. We
        do not issue refunds on custom made items (Made to Measure), once work has commenced
        on the order.

        We guarantee the quality and high standards of our workmanship. If our
        product is not fit for purpose because of customer error, no refunds will be given.
        If our product is faulty or we have made an error, a full refund will be given.
